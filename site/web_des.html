<h2> Web design </h2>
<p>
In order to obtain the basic knowledge I deem needed to fulfil my goals i used a lot of resources.<br>
Due mind, I know that there are a lot of tools to shorten web development, as well as doing this up-to standard.<br>
a lot of the things that i do are considered dirty or bad coding. I agree but the thing is at least for me is learning and all of these automated tools usually just hide the actual implementation from the developer.<br>
so i took another approach - do it manually slowly - so i can actually learn the basics.<br>
as with everything else once you worked yourself through the basics, everything else seems easier.<br>

I will try and document some to give anyone interested a starting point:
</p>
<p>
<h3><a href="https://www.sololearn.com/" target=_blank">SoloLearn</a></h3>
<p> a very nice start to learn some coding; for me what did it was the App - you can learn from anywhere on your cellphone or tablet.<br>
now, do mind that coding on any portable device, at least for me, is not really helpful. but it did enable me to utilize my commute time; I used it to learn the basics and at home i finished the rest
</p>
<p>
<h3><a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target=_blank">W3 schools</a></h3>
<p> I doubt that anyone that wants to learn anything related to the web has not encountered this site a some point. <br>
It is extensive, sometimes it might be too extensive at least if you are coming to the process without any prior experience.<br>
I still use it as reference - at least for that purpose it is unmatched
</p>

<h3><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" target=_blank">CSS grid</a></h3>
<p> CSS grid - i found this to be extremely helpful tool.<br>
I admit CSS styling with direct box\div control was extremely difficult to me.
This allows one to design nice looking pages very easily
