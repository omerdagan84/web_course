<h2> introduction </h2>
<p>
I am interested in technology as a whole, as such i try my best to be familiar with as many issues as possible.
Due to the fact that i am working full time as an embedded engineer my time resoureces are all but limited.
that said i am still always trying to improve myself and my knowledge.

I have worked on Arduino projects for my own purposes such as amall home automation projects.
During my carrer so far i have done quite a lot. i have worked on Microcontrollers such as STM-32 and done several POC's based onarduino i had some limmited experiance with PIC based MCs as well.

I built several AOSP projects for different boards mainly NXPs i.MX series.

I built customized Linux distributions for these boards usually either with BusyBox or the Yocto project.

in the future i intend to developthis work.
</p>

<p>
I have a dream, i want to build a home automation system (not a commercial one) for myself; I want it to include several elements which i hope will help me to extend my knowledge and sharpen my skills in all the above mentioned areas
<ul>
<li>Sensor nodes based on arduino</li>
<li>Communication based on simple 433MHz ICs</li>
<li>a Raspberry PI based HUB connected to a smart mirror diplay
<ul>
<li>Implement IBM Watson Natural speech capabilities</li>
<li> a simple network interface for remote control and reporting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This site helps me to familiarize myself with WEB programming; there is still alot to learn but i see it as a step forward
